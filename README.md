## Purpose of this Application

The purpose of building this application was to get further practice on handling forms, event listeners, writing functional and class components.


## Programming Technologies impoemented for this Application:

- JavaScript (es5 & es6)
- CSS3
- HTML5
- MySQL

## Application Features:

- User can add a card and enter a title.
- User can also Edit the title by clicking into the card.
- User can add and edit description.
- User can add, edit and delete activity logs.
- User can drag and swap cards between "Todo", "Doing", and "Done" columns.
- User can Change background wallpapers by searching any topics in the wallpaper section in the hamburger menu. 
- All data will be saved in a data base and when the user returns, the data will re-render. 

## What I've learned:

From this project, I was able to get a good experience on how hashmapping works and how useful it is when I needed to store data in key value pairs. 
It really helped me to write more efficient and readable code by eliminating nested loops. I've also learned there are so many useful event listeners such as onDragstart, onDrag, onDragOver, onDrop that allows developers to build more interactive applications. 

## What I can improve on:

I need to be very careful and practice on naming my variables. As components got more complicated, I started to lose my understanding where the variables came from and what they did. Secondly, I need to learn React Context so that I can avoid props drilling which can help me write cleaner code and exactly know where the props are getting passed to and from.
